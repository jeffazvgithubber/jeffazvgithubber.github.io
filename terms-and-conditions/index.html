<li>Where any identification, credit or other verification check we require cannot be competed to our satisfaction because you have not provided any document we request from you in the form that we require within 30 days’ of the date the document was first requested, then we are under no obligation to continue with the verification check and may in our sole discretion deactivate your Customer Account.</li>
<li>Players who request the redemption of Prizes held in a deactivated or suspended account should contact Customer Support by emailing <a href="mailto:support@chumbacasino.com">support@chumbacasino.com</a>.

<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to limit a Participant’s redemption of Prizes to USD$10,000 per day.  
<p><b>Your Responsibility for Prize Redemptions and Accuracy of Details</b></li>
<li>It is your sole responsibility to ensure that your financial institution will accept payment of Prizes from us into your bank account. VGW Group has no obligation to check whether your financial institution will accept transfer of Prizes from us to your nominated bank account.</li>
<li>We will not pay Prizes into:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>a joint account or joint online wallet; or</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>into an account or online wallet which does not match the name you provided when registering your Customer Account. Where you are required to provide the details of your financial institution, bank account or online wallet, you agree that you are solely responsible for the accuracy of those details.

<li>You acknowledge and agree that, if your financial institution will not accept transfer of Prizes from VGW Group or where your bank account or online wallet does not meet the requirements in these Terms and Conditions:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>you will be required to nominate an alternative bank account for the payment of Prizes;</li>
<li>there will be delays in the processing of your Prizes; and</li>
<li>if you are unable to nominate an alternative bank account which meets the requirements set out in these Terms and Conditions within 60 days of a request from us to do so, VGW Group is not obliged to transfer the Prizes to you and may in its discretion deem the Prizes to be void.
<p><b>Currency</b></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Direct bank transfer payments are executed in USD. It is a Player’s responsibility to ensure that their nominated bank account can accept transactions in USD.
<p><b>Timing and Frequency for Payment</b></li>
<li>We process requests to redeem Prizes in the order in which they are received. Our goal is to process your request as soon as practicable.</li>
<li>We will only process one Prize redemption request per Customer Account in any 24 hour period.</li>
<li>You acknowledge and agree that it may take up to 10 business days to process the payment of redeemed Prizes into your nominated bank account.  </li>
<li>Payment of Prizes may experience delays due to our identity verification process and certain payment methods will require additional verification at time of redemption.</li>
<li>Prizes of over USD$10,000 may require a longer processing time than usual due to bank clearance and security and fraud checks and may also be paid in more than one lump sum. This may add up to 7 days to the normal processing time, but is dependent on the circumstances of each individual case.</li>
<li>Without limiting clause 7.8, Players can request any amount of Prizes to be redeemed, however we reserve the right to pay Prizes in smaller increments over a number of days until all of the Prize has been paid.
<p><b>Payment Administration Agent</b></li>
<li>You acknowledge and agree that we may in our sole discretion, from time to time, appoint our related bodies corporate, affiliates, or any other third party to act as our agent (“<b>Payment Administration Agent</b>”) to accept or make payments (including merchant facilities) from or to Players on our behalf.</li>

<li>$weeps Cash™ is only valid for 60 days from the date you last logged on to your Customer Account and will thereafter automatically expire.  </li>
<li>$weeps Cash™ may be forfeited if a Customer Account is deactivated for any reason, or at our discretion.
<p><b>Updating Payment Details</b></li>
<li>Updating or adding additional payment details for the sole purpose of redeeming Prizes may only be done by you when logged into your Customer Account and when you are undergoing the process of redeeming a Prize. We cannot update or add additional payment details on your behalf.
<p><b>Refused Prizes</b></li>
<li>If you refuse to accept payment of Prizes made to your nominated bank account by VGW Group, you must refuse the amount in its entirety. Where you refuse to accept payment to your nominated bank account more than twice in any 3 month period, VGW Group reserves the right to suspend your Customer Account to undertake investigations to ensure that the Platforms are not being used as a vehicle for fraudulent activity.
<p><b>Mistaken Credits</b></li>
<li>If we mistakenly credit your Customer Account from time to time with Prizes that do not belong to you, whether due to a technical error, human error or otherwise, the amount will remain VGW Group property and will be deducted from your Customer Account. If you have been credited funds that do not belong to you prior to us becoming aware of the error, the mistakenly paid amount will (without prejudice to other remedies and actions that may be available at law) constitute a debt owed by you to us. In the event of an incorrect crediting, you are obliged to notify Customer Support by using the “Contact” link on the Platform without delay.
