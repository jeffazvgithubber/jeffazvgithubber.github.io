Our initial focus is on the US, “the home of casinos”, and Canada, but we intend to expand globally very soon, making Chumba Casino truly global!</span></p>\n<p><b>IS CHUMBA CASINO THE ONLY SOCIAL GAMING COMPANY TO USE SWEEPSTAKES PRIZES?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, gaming companies offering sweepstakes with prizes is nothing new. There have been, and still are, many companies offering sweepstakes with prizes.</span></p>\n<p><b>WHAT ARE “SWEEPSTAKES”?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweepstakes are trade promotions with prizes. They are used to promote the sales of products – in our case – our Gold Coins &#8211; through prize giveaways and have been used for decades, worldwide.</span></p>\n<p><b>HOW DOES CHUMBA CASINO’S SWEEPSTAKES MODEL WORK?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chumba Casino, sells Gold Coins, a virtual currency which you can accumulate and play with, but which cannot be traded, transferred or redeemed for real money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No purchase is necessary to enter Chumba Casino’s sweepstakes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entries into Chumba Casino’s sweepstakes are given to players in the form of $weeps Cash™</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. $weeps Cash</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">™</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cannot be purchased and it has no inherent value.

This is to make sure that cash prizes are sent to the correct account holder. Once we receive the required verification documents from you, we verify them as soon as possible. The process of redemption depends on whether or not you have sent the correct form of identification to us. It normally takes about 5 days for completion of the verification process. Once your account is verified, it takes approximately 10 days for your cash prize to be processed to your account.</span></p>\n<p><b>WHAT SORT OF DOCUMENTS DO I NEED FOR MY ACCOUNT TO BECOME VERIFIED?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will need 2 of the following documents to be sent at support@chumbacasino.com:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1) A valid primary photo ID , which can be any of the following:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Passport</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Driver&#8217;s license</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National/State ID</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other government issued ID, aside from the ones mentioned above (Veteran&#8217;s ID, etc.)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2) A supporting document under your name as proof of address: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Utility Bill (electricity, telco, water, etc. not older than 3 months)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notarized agreement form for lease (nothing hand-written)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bank statements </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medical insurance</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOLD COINS AND $WEEPS CASH<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">™</span></b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gold Coins can be purchased by players to use with games in Gold Coin mode. Gold Coins can be used to play Chumba Casino games, but they cannot be transferred, traded or redeemed for cash prizes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Players can always obtain $weeps Cash™</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> free of charge as a bonus with the purchase of Gold Coins, or via an Alternative Methods of Entry (AMOE) such as mailing in. $weeps Cash™</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be used to play Chumba Casino games in $weeps Cash™</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> mode. $weeps Cash™</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> won as prizes (from playing our $weeps Cash™</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> games) can be redeemed as cash prizes. </span></p>\n<p><b>WHAT OTHER COMPANIES USE SWEEPSTAKES?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many companies worldwide use sweepstakes to promote and sell their products. Sweepstakes promotions have been running for decades in the US and other countries around the world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies such as McDonalds, Publishers Clearing House, Reader’s Digest, Pepsi and Proctor &amp; Gamble all hold widely known, and often global, sweepstakes promotions.</span></p>\n<p><b>WHAT IS THE RISK LAWS WILL JUST CHANGE?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low. Sweepstakes are regulated in the US is on a state-by-state basis, so laws in 50 states would need to change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further, since Sweepstakes trade promotions are offered by a large number of brands and companies, including many multinationals, any regulatory change would have broad consequences and likely be challenged.</span></p>\n<p><b>SO WHY CAN&#8217;T OTHER CASINO COMPANIES IMPLEMENT THE SAME SWEEPSTAKES MODEL?</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Patent: Chumba Casino uses patent-pending technology in its sweepstakes model. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regulatory &amp; Partner risks: Our competitors are generally reluctant to explore innovative models that are not considered “mainstream”. This extends to key marketing, distribution and payment processing partners, who competitors would need to satisfy as to the legitimacy of their business model, a process which has taken Chumba Casino several years.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology &amp; Operations: The technology required to operate a sweepstakes prize platform is very different to that of a virtual currency only game, requiring far more robust, secure and thorough gameplay and reporting functionality. Operations supporting sweepstakes are also very different to games companies, as the payments, fraud and customer service profiles are very different.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>CAN CHUMBA CASINO’S SWEEPSTAKES MODEL APPLY TO OTHER GAMING PRODUCTS?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. Some of these are offered at our sister site </span><a href=\"http://www.globalpoker.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.globalpoker.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><b>HOW DO I DEPOSIT MONEY INTO MY CHUMBA CASINO ACCOUNT?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You </span><b>cannot deposit money into your Chumba Casino account</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Chumba Casino is not a ‘traditional online casino site’ where you can deposit money to play with. Chumba Casino is a social casino site which offers game play for our two virtual currencies, Gold Coins and $weeps Cash™</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to enjoy the fun of the Gold Coin play all you need to do is register and you are ready to start playing.

Please refer to paragraph 7 of the $weeps Rules with respect to your responsibility for the payment of taxes. </span></p>\n<p><b>HOW RANDOM ARE THE SPINS USED FOR CHUMBA CASINO SLOTS GAMES?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Random Number Generator (RNG) used by Chumba Casino utilises a Mersenne Twister with background cycling. This was certified by iTechLabs who confirmed that it uses a well known algorithm to generate random numbers. The numbers generated by this RNG have passed Marsaglia&#8217;s “diehard” tests for statistical randomness. iTech Labs has found that number sequences are unpredictable, non-repeatable and uniformly distributed.</span></p>\n","content_bottom":null,"about_image":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.6908315565031984,"src":"/static/9bc974899f0e08a33b993b8e5317bde6/3fa08/game_screens.png","srcSet":"/static/9bc974899f0e08a33b993b8e5317bde6/6dea1/game_screens.png 125w,\n/static/9bc974899f0e08a33b993b8e5317bde6/69781/game_screens.png 250w,\n/static/9bc974899f0e08a33b993b8e5317bde6/3fa08/game_screens.png 500w,\n/static/9bc974899f0e08a33b993b8e5317bde6/5a67f/game_screens.png 750w,\n/static/9bc974899f0e08a33b993b8e5317bde6/56cc9/game_screens.png 793w","srcWebp":"/static/9bc974899f0e08a33b993b8e5317bde6/71b1f/game_screens.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/9bc974899f0e08a33b993b8e5317bde6/df633/game_screens.webp 125w,\n/static/9bc974899f0e08a33b993b8e5317bde6/9ed04/game_screens.webp 250w,\n/static/9bc974899f0e08a33b993b8e5317bde6/71b1f/game_screens.webp 500w,\n/static/9bc974899f0e08a33b993b8e5317bde6/1d22b/game_screens.webp 750w,\n/static/9bc974899f0e08a33b993b8e5317bde6/a7397/game_screens.webp 793w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c9f17a70-8a5e-5ec6-af53-f6a9f30417a3"}}
